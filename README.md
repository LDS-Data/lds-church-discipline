All publicly known disciplinary councils of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with outcomes and additional notes if known.

NOTE: This is a work in progress. Entries without citations should be considered unverified.

* [Byron Merchant](https://ordainwomen.org/byrons-song/)—14 Oct 1977—For opposition to the race-based priesthood and temple ban.

* [Sonia Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Johnson)—5 Dec 1979—Excommunicated for her work in promoting the ERA.

The September 6 (1992), including the following:

* D. Michael Quinn—Historian and BYU professor from 1976-1988. He was excommunicated for his writings about belief in seer stones in the early church and the practice of polygamy with official sanction after the 1890 manifesto .

* Lavina Fielding Anderson—Scholar, writer, editor, and feminist. Her detailed account of spiritual abuse by Mormon leaders between the 1970s and 1990s was the grounds for her excommunication.

* Martha Nibley Beck – Scholar and author. Excommunicated for her public writings which were deemed to be critical of the church. She was a part time faculty at BYU at the time and is the daughter of Hugh Nibley, a well-known Mormon apologist.

* Lynne Kanavel Whitesides – Noted speaker on Mother in Heaven

* Avraham Gileadi – Author and interpreter of the Book of Isiah. He was later reinstated into the church and continues to publish on the book of Isiah.

* Paul Toscano (and later wife Margaret in 2000) were excommunicated for their writings about the whitewashing of Mormon history, hierarchal authoritarianism, and feminist issues.

Post Sept. 6 excommunications, possibly part of the same or a similar wave of actions:

* David Wright, a professor of Hebrew studies and the Bible at Brandeis University , excommunicated in April 1994 for articles asserting the Book of Mormon was a 19th-century creation of church founder Joseph Smith.

* Michael Barrett – 1994: Assistant general counsel for the CIA, excommunicated for disobedience after writing letters to editors of several newspapers correcting news stories about Mormonism.

* Brent Metcalfe – 1994: Editor of the anthology "New Approaches to the Book of Mormon," published by Signature Books in Salt Lake City. Metcalfe also edited "American Apocrypha," which included the article in which Murphy used genetic research to challenge the Book of Mormon doctrine that American Indians are descendants of ancient Israelite families. Metcalfe developed the theory that the Book of Mormon was translated starting at Mosiah and that the first books in the current manuscript were produced later .

* Janice Merrill Allred – A relative and collaborator with several of the September 6, Allred is a feminist who was disciplined in 1994 and excommunicated in 1995. Some consider her excommunication as part of the September 6. She is the mother of 9 and her husband was a physics professor at BYU.

* Margaret Toscano – 2000: A classics professor at the University of Utah, excommunicated for writing on feminist issues after being told not to. Margaret was originally slated to be excommunicated at the time of the September 6, but her Bishop refused to follow the direction of the upper church authorities. Her husband, Paul, was one of the September 6.

* Shane LeGrande Whelan, author of "More Than One: Plural Marriage, A Sacred Heritage, A Promise For Tomorrow," excommunicated Aug. 11 2002 for refusing to stop marketing his self-published book. His wife, Rhonda, who researched material for the book, was disfellowshipped two weeks later. She has since divorced him.

* [Grant Palmer](https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2487004&itype=NGPSID)—12 Dec 2004—Disfellowshipped for apostasy on account of his book, _An Insider's View of Mormon Origins_.

* Kate Kelly – 2014 – Feminist and founder of the Ordain Women movement. This movement arguably played a role in women being allowed to give prayers in General Conference since 2013. Others in the movement have had their temple recommends taken away and/or been excommunicated.

* John Dehlin – 2015 – Host of Mormon Stories podcast. He advocated honesty in evaluating the historical claims of the LDS church and tried to stay in the faith while not believing the divinity claims. He has interviewed 100s of people starting in 2005 and discussed a number of topics including their experiences with general authorities, excommunication, losing their faith, etc.

* [Bruce Holt](http://www.mormonthink.com/personalstories/bruce-holt.htm)—30 Mar 2016—For a Facebook post denouncing Joseph Smith as a "fraud".

* Jeremy Runnells – 2016 – Author of “The CES Letter” was disciplined for creating a document which asks questions regarding the history of the LDS faith and challenges its truth claims. The letter was written in about 2013 and went viral shortly thereafter. He resigned during his excommunication proceeding.

* Sam Young – 2018 – Leader of the “Protect LDS Children movement” which was encouraging church leaders to stop asking sexually explicit questions to minors during one on one interview.

* Bill Reel - Dec 2018 – Popular Mormon podcaster who among other things created a podcast which accused Holland of telling 5 specific lies.

* Leah and Cody Young – 2019 – Although not prominent, these members were excommunicated for starting a support group for former or questioning members. Although they were deliberate to not reach out to active members, their Stake president chose to excommunicate them for their efforts to help others. This is one of several cases between 2010 and 2020 where low-level members are excommunicated due to social media posts or other seemingly benign actions.
