## Post-September-Six

* Brent Metcalfe – 1994: Editor of the anthology "New Approaches to the Book of Mormon," published by Signature Books in Salt Lake City. Metcalfe also edited "American Apocrypha," which included the article in which Murphy used genetic research to challenge the Book of Mormon doctrine that American Indians are descendants of ancient Israelite families. Metcalfe developed the theory that the Book of Mormon was translated starting at Mosiah and that the first books in the current manuscript were produced later .

* Janice Merrill Allred – A relative and collaborator with several of the September 6, Allred is a feminist who was disciplined in 1994 and excommunicated in 1995. Some consider her excommunication as part of the September 6. She is the mother of 9 and her husband was a physics professor at BYU.

* Margaret Toscano – 2000: A classics professor at the University of Utah, excommunicated for writing on feminist issues after being told not to. Margaret was originally slated to be excommunicated at the time of the September 6, but her Bishop refused to follow the direction of the upper church authorities. Her husband, Paul, was one of the September 6.

* Kate Kelly – 2014 – Feminist and founder of the Ordain Women movement. This movement arguably played a role in women being allowed to give prayers in General Conference since 2013. Others in the movement have had their temple recommends taken away and/or been excommunicated.

* John Dehlin – 2015 – Host of Mormon Stories podcast. He advocated honesty in evaluating the historical claims of the LDS church and tried to stay in the faith while not believing the divinity claims. He has interviewed 100s of people starting in 2005 and discussed a number of topics including their experiences with general authorities, excommunication, losing their faith, etc.

* [Bruce Holt](http://www.mormonthink.com/personalstories/bruce-holt.htm)—30 Mar 2016—For a Facebook post denouncing Joseph Smith as a "fraud".

* Leah and Cody Young – 2019 – Although not prominent, these members were excommunicated for starting a support group for former or questioning members.
