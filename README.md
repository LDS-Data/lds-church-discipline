## 19th Century

* Burr Riggs (1811-1860)—26 Feb 1833—Zelph Co-discoverer—[Excommunicated by a conference of high priests in Kirtland, for "neglecting to make satisfaction to the church as he had agreed, and disgracing the high priesthood by neglect of duty and saying he did not care how soon he was cut off from the church. &c. &c"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/281) On [February 13th](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/280), a "council of High priests assembled to investigate the proceedings of Bro Burr Riggs, who was accused of not magnifying his calling as a high priest, but had been guilty of neglect of duty, of abusing the elders, and of treating their admonitions with contempt. After the council had considered the case, Brother Riggs agreed to make satisfaction, but did not shew much humility." After his excommunication he was [later reinstated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/burr-riggs) in the church, and also later excommunicated, and reinstated yet again.

* [Doctor Philastus Hurlbut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Philastus_Hurlbut)—3 Jun 1833—Amorous Apostate, Early Church Foe—[Excommunicated in absentia for "unchristian conduct with the female sex while on a mission to the east"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/16). He was found sufficiently penitent upon appeal that [his membership was restored 21 Jun 1833](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/25) only to be [revoked again two days later](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/26) because he had reportedly claimed to have "deceived" the prior council. He went on to become a prominent—perhaps _notorious_—critic of Mormonism, being a major contributor to Eber D. Howe's _Mormonism Unvailed_, for which he collected affidavits against the character of Joseph Smith and his family.

* Daniel Copley—21 Jun 1833—Reluctant missionary—[Excommunicated "because he refused to fulfil his mission according to the Council of the High Priesthood of the holy order of God"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minutes-21-june-1833/1). Much like his likewise-excommunicated father, Leman Copley, Daniel Copley struggled to be "all in" on the church. When assigned to serve a mission with (later excommunicated) Doctor Philastus Hurlbut, [he refused](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/daniel-copley). He later went on to serve in the First Regiment of Wisconsin Volunteers in the American Civil War.

* James Patten—7 Aug 1835—[Excommunicated for "improper conduct, and refusing to give up his license"](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-2-chapter-17).

* [John F. Boynton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Boynton) (1811-1890)—3 Sep 1837—Apostle, Geologist, Inventor—[Disfellowshipped by conference vote](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/239). He was a founding member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who grew dissatisfied after the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society. [Reinstated a week later](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/244). [Repeatedly disfellowshipped](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/255) (along with numerous others)<!--TODO--> for "dancing with the world" and [attending balls](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-1/260).

* [John F. Boynton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Boynton) (1811-1890)—1837—Apostle, Geologist, Inventor—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/john-farnham-boynton?highlight=John%20Farnham%20Boynton). It's quite possible, based on the prior disfellowshipments for dancing, that John F. Boynton was excommunicated for refusing to stop dancing.

* [W. W. Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Phelps_(Mormon)) (1792-1872)—10 Mar 1838—Printer and hymnist—[Excommunicated for alleged mishandling of Far West land, and temple donations](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/110).

* [Oliver Cowdery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cowdery) (1806-1850)—12 Apr 1838—Book of Mormon Witness, Apostle, Second Elder, Assistant President—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/17) [on six different charges, including his accusation that Joseph Smith was an adulterer](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/16) due to his relationship with Fanny Alger which Cowdery termed a "dirty, nasty, filthy affair". He was rebaptized into the LDS church in 1848.

* [Joseph Coe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Coe) (1784-1854)—Dec 1838—Kirtland High Councilor, Book of Abraham Financier, Safety Society Dissenter—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/joseph-coe) following the collapse of the Kirtland Safety Society.

Hinkle, Sampson Avard, John Corrill, Reed Peck, William W. Phelps, Frederick G. Williams, Thomas B. Marsh, Burr Riggs, and several others. After which the conference closed by prayer. [History of the Church, Vol. 3, Chapter 20](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667)

* [Sampson Avard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampson_Avard) (1800-1869)—17 Mar 1839—Founding Danite who testified against Joseph Smith in court—Excommunicated by a conference of the church.

* [George M. Hinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Hinkle) (1801-1861)—17 Mar 1839—Militia leader who turned Joseph Smith over to the Missourians—Excommunicated by a conference of the church. It was later shown that [he turned the Mormon prophet over in bad faith](https://www.deseret.com/2010/2/14/20096307/speaker-says-militia-leader-betrayed-joseph-smith), expecting him to be executed.

* [John Corrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Corrill) (1794-1842)—17 Mar 1839—Early Mormon leader, Missouri legislator involved with handing Joseph Smith over to the Missourians—Excommunicated by a conference of the church. He also testified against Joseph Smith and the Mormons in court.

* Reed Peck (1814-1894)—17 Mar 1839—Attempted peaceful resolution of Mormon War—Excommunicated by a conference of the church, not long after [his disaffection from the church and testifying against Joseph Smith in court](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/reed-peck).

* [W. W. Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Phelps_(Mormon)) (1792-1872)—17 Mar 1839—Printer and hymnist—Excommunicated by a conference of the church for testifying against Joseph Smith in court, helping put him in Liberty Jail.

* [Thomas B. Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_B._Marsh) (1800-1866)—17 Mar 1839—First President of the Quroum of the Twelve Apostles—Excommunicated by a conference of the church, likely because he drafted and signed an affidavit against Joseph Smith in connection with the Missouri Mormon War, in which he expressed his concerns over the violent tactics of the Mormons. Marsh's move away from the church [may have been initiated](https://juvenileinstructor.org/thomas-b-marshs-reconciliation-with-george-w-harris/) by a dispute between his wife Elizabeth and Lucinda Harris over a pint of milk skimmings, which the First Presidency supposedly decided in Lucinda's favor; then again, that story may be fabulous. Thomas B. Marsh is known to have made a reconciliation with Lucinda's husband George in 1857; soon thereafter he moved to Utah where he was rebaptized into the church. He lived his days out as a pauper.

* Burr Riggs (1811-1860)—17 Mar 1839—Zelph Co-discoverer—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/burr-riggs), for reasons unclear.

### Post-Quincy Conference

* [Gladden Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop) (1809-1864)—11 Mar 1842—Would-be Prophet—[Excommunicated for promulgating his own revelations deemed inconsistent with those of the church](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/21). His trial was held before the Nauvoo High Council with Joseph Smith presiding. When asked to present his revelations, Bishop initially refused, but Joseph Smith invoked his mayoral authority to issue a "warrant" for the revelations which were then obtained. Bishop read portions of his revelations aloud and was met with laughter for what the official record termed "the extreme of folly, nonsense, absurdity, falsehood, and bombastic egotism". The revelations were then ["condemned" and "committed to the flames" and he was "cut off from the church and given over to the buffetings of Satan untill the day of the Lord Jesus](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets?id=28b53d73-2ba2-418b-8ef7-dafcc935bee3&crate=0&index=140)."

* [John C. Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bennett) (1804-1867)—11 May 1842—Physician, Assistant President in First Presidency, Nauvoo Mayor, Spiritual Wifery Proponent—[Excommunicated for adultery](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/john-cook-bennett) on account of his practice of "spiritual wifery", a form of free love. Soon thereafter he was expelled from the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, and he and his wife divorced. In turn he accused Joseph Smith of attempting to assassinate former Governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs, and of adulterous relationships under the guise of polygamy. Bennett later went on to join the Strangite faction of Mormonism, from which he was also excommunicated for sexual improprieties. He also became known for his promotion of the tomato and certain breeds of chickens.

### Interregnum

* [Josiah Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Butterfield) (1795-1871)—7 Oct 1844——[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/josiah-butterfield) as a consequence of disaffection stemming from a personal conflict with Joseph Smith over an estate settlement.

Along with fellow apostle Matthias F. Cowley, he had previous resigned the apostleship at the request of church president Joseph F. Smith, to eliminate the awkward presence of an avowed polygamist in church leadership during the Reed-Smoot hearings.

Along with fellow apostle John W. Taylor, he had previous resigned the apostleship at the request of church president Joseph F. Smith, to eliminate the awkward presence of an avowed polygamist in church leadership during the Reed-Smoot hearings. His non-standard penalty for insubordination was removed and his priesthood restored 3 Apr 1936.

Richard McCoy, Jr., hijacked a United Airlines passenger jet for ransom in 1972, four months after the more infamous D.B. Cooper carried out a similar and still-unsolved hijacking.

The "conduct inappropriate of a member of the church" referred to accusations of verbal abuse against his stepdaughter. His wife Rhonda was [disfellowshipped for her role researching the book](https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/dissident-lds-intellectuals-say-excommunications-will-continue/article_76202a5a-4c5c-5129-9fcd-aefbe0988466.html) and subsequently divorced her husband.

Her movement—as well as excommunication—immediately preceded [a raft of changes increasing women's roles in the church](http://religiondispatches.org/historic-prayer-by-woman-at-lds-general-conference-signals-growing-concern-with-gender-equality/), including women praying in General Conference, more prominent female mission leadership, a lowered age for female missionary service, and improved curriculum for the Young Women program.

He advocated honesty in evaluating the historical claims of the LDS church and tried to stay in the faith while not believing the divinity claims. The podcast enabled critical viewpoints to gain a wider audience, and gave doubting and otherwise-marginalized Mormons a sense of community and support. 

* [Bruce Holt](http://www.mormonthink.com/personalstories/bruce-holt.htm)—30 Mar 2016—For a Facebook post denouncing Joseph Smith as a "fraud".

He was disciplined for creating a document which asks questions regarding the history of the LDS faith and challenges its truth claims.

His Protect LDS Children initiative collected over a thousand stories describing harms experienced during such youth interviews and supported protest actions including a signature drive and hunger strike.

* Bill Reel—2 Dec 2018—_Mormon Dicussions_ podcaster—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/bill-reel-excommunication/) largely for accusing church apostle Jeffrey R. Holland of repeated falsehoods which he called out in a podcast episode, "[Elder Holland – Liar Liar Pants on Fire](https://mormondiscussionpodcast.org/2018/10/mormon-discussion-premium-elder-holland-liar-liar-pants-on-fire/)".

Although they were deliberate to not reach out to active members, their Stake president chose to excommunicate them for their efforts to help others. This is one of several cases between 2010 and 2020 where low-level members are excommunicated due to social media posts or other seemingly benign actions.

* [Julie Rowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Rowe)—7 Apr 2019—Energy healing and preparedness author and visionary—[Excommunicated for "apostasy, teaching false doctrine, priestcraft, and defaming the good name of the church"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPl8t1XnKw).
