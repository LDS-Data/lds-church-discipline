The "conduct inappropriate of a member of the church" referred to accusations of verbal abuse against his stepdaughter. His wife Rhonda was [disfellowshipped for her role researching the book](https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/dissident-lds-intellectuals-say-excommunications-will-continue/article_76202a5a-4c5c-5129-9fcd-aefbe0988466.html) and subsequently divorced her husband.

Although they were deliberate to not reach out to active members, their Stake president chose to excommunicate them for their efforts to help others. This is one of several cases between 2010 and 2020 where low-level members are excommunicated due to social media posts or other seemingly benign actions.

* [Julie Rowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Rowe)—7 Apr 2019—Energy healing and preparedness author and visionary—[Excommunicated for "apostasy, teaching false doctrine, priestcraft, and defaming the good name of the church"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPl8t1XnKw).
