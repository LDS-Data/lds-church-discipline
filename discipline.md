A former Quaker and Shaker, his conversion to Mormonism introduced strain on his marriage that may have been a factor in his estrangement from the church.

* Burr Riggs (1811-1860)—26 Feb 1833—Zelph Co-discoverer—[Excommunicated by a conference of high priests in Kirtland, for "neglecting to make satisfaction to the church as he had agreed, and disgracing the high priesthood by neglect of duty and saying he did not care how soon he was cut off from the church. &c. &c"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/281) On [February 13th](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/280), a "council of High priests assembled to investigate the proceedings of Bro Burr Riggs, who was accused of not magnifying his calling as a high priest, but had been guilty of neglect of duty, of abusing the elders, and of treating their admonitions with contempt. After the council had considered the case, Brother Riggs agreed to make satisfaction, but did not shew much humility." After his excommunication he was [later reinstated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/burr-riggs) in the church, and also later excommunicated, and reinstated yet again.

Howe's _Mormonism Unvailed_, for which he collected affidavits against the character of Joseph Smith and his family.

* Daniel Copley (abt. 1811-1862)—21 Jun 1833—Reluctant missionary—[Excommunicated "because he refused to fulfill his mission according to the Council of the High Priesthood of the holy order of God"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minutes-21-june-1833/1). Much like his likewise-excommunicated father, Leman Copley, Daniel Copley struggled to be "all in" on the church. When assigned to serve a mission with (later excommunicated) Doctor Philastus Hurlbut, [he refused](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/daniel-copley). He later went on to serve in the First Regiment of Wisconsin Volunteers in the American Civil War.

McLellin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._McLellin) (1806-1883)—4 Aug 1835—Original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—[Disfellowshipped](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-to-quorum-of-the-twelve-4-august-1835/2) for failing to solicit donations for "a house in which to receive an endowment", and for a "libel" against the church due to this seemingly innocuous quotation from a letter he wrote his wife: "You say, that it will not be in your power to go to school this summer---I am glad that it is not, since Eld\[e\]r \[Orson\] Hyde has returned and given, me a description of the manner in which it is conducted. though we do not wish to cast any reflections."

The "Journal History of the Church" in 1859 [reported](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets?id=6356ac4d-c36f-483c-b90e-37ce4fa02547&crate=0&index=266) that he had "apostatized" in 1838 and "went with Geo\[rge\] M. Hinkle", the later-excommunicated militia leader who turned Joseph Smith over to the Missourians.

* [John Gaylord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gaylord) (1797-1874)—13 Jan 1838—Member of the Presidency of the Seventy—[Excommunicated for "rising up in rebellion against the church"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/back/general-church-officers-october-1835-january-1838), reportedly due to his bitterness over the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society.

Phelps for "persisting in unchristian like conduct"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/110). The minutes of the Far West High Council recorded: "After some remarks by Presidents Marsh & Patten, setting forth the iniquity of those men, in claiming the $2.000 spoken of, which did not belong to them any more than any other person in the church; it was decided that William W. Phelps and John Whitmer be no longer members of the church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, & be given over to the buffetings of Satan, until they learn to blaspheme no more against the authorities of God, nor fleece the flock of Christ." He was driven from Far West along with other "dissenters". After Joseph Smith's death he supported his brother's (David Whitmer's) claim to church leadership.

* [W. W. Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Phelps_(Mormon)) (1792-1872)—10 Mar 1838—Printer and hymnist—[Excommunicated alongside John Whitmer for "persisting in unchristian like conduct"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/110), specifically for alleged mishandling of Far West land, and temple donations.

He was rebaptized into the LDS church in 1848.

* [Lyman E. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_E._Johnson) (1811-1859)—13 Apr 1838——[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/134) in Far West on [seven different charges](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/130), including "virtually denying the faith of the Church of Christ of Latter Day saints, by vindicating the cause of the enemies of this Church, who are dissenters from us", "seeking to injure the character of Joseph Smith jr", and "taking whiskey and making Weldon drink & then cheating him out of his property". The minutes record that "After some few appropriate remarks, by the Councellors, it was decided by the President that Lyman E. Johnson be no longer considered a member of the Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints, nor a member of the Quorum of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb and also be given over to the buffetings of Satan untill he learns to blaspheme no more against the authorities of God."

* [David Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Whitmer) (1805-1888)—13 Apr 1838—Book of Mormon Witness, founding church member—[Withdrew his membership from the church](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/136) in response to [numerous charges](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/minute-book-2/135): "First, For not observing the word of wisdom, 2 for unchristian-like conduct in neglecting to attend to meetings, in uniting, with, and possessing the same spirit with the Dissenters, in writing letters to the Dissenters in Kirtland unfavorable to the cause and to Br Joseph Smith jr. 3nd For neglecting the duties of his calling. 4th, For seperating himself from the cause and the Church while he has a name among us. 5 For signing himself President of the Church of Christ in an insulting letter to the High Council." Along with other dissenters, [he was driven from Missouri a few months later](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/david-whitmer), presumably by "Danites" inspired by Sidney Rigdon's "Salt Sermon". These removals added to Mormon-Missourian tensions that resulted in the 1838 Mormon War and ultimately the infamous [Missouri Executive Order 44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Executive_Order_44) ordering the Mormons "treated as enemies" and "exterminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public peace." David Whitmer maintained his belief in the Book of Mormon throughout his life. He never rejoined the LDS church.

* [William E. McLellin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._McLellin) (1806-1883)—11 May 1838—Original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-march-september-1838/26) because he expressed he had no confidence in the church's leaders, perhaps as a response to the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society.

* [George M. Hinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Hinkle) (1801-1861)—17 Mar 1839—Militia leader who turned Joseph Smith over to the Missourians—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667). It was later shown that [he turned the Mormon prophet over in bad faith](https://www.deseret.com/2010/2/14/20096307/speaker-says-militia-leader-betrayed-joseph-smith), expecting him to be executed.

* [John Corrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Corrill) (1794-1842)—17 Mar 1839—Early Mormon leader, Missouri legislator involved with handing Joseph Smith over to the Missourians—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667).

* [W. W. Phelps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Phelps_(Mormon)) (1792-1872)—17 Mar 1839—Printer and hymnist—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667), possibly for testifying against Joseph Smith in court, helping put him in Liberty Jail.

* [Thomas B. Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_B._Marsh) (1800-1866)—17 Mar 1839—First President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667), likely because he drafted and signed an affidavit against Joseph Smith in connection with the Missouri Mormon War, in which he expressed his concerns over the violent tactics of the Mormons. Marsh's move away from the church [may have been initiated](https://juvenileinstructor.org/thomas-b-marshs-reconciliation-with-george-w-harris/) by a dispute between his wife Elizabeth and Lucinda Harris over a pint of milk skimmings, which the First Presidency supposedly decided in Lucinda's favor; then again, that story may be fabulous. Thomas B. Marsh is known to have made a reconciliation with Lucinda's husband George in 1857; soon thereafter he moved to Utah where he was rebaptized into the church. He lived his days out as a pauper.

* Burr Riggs (1811-1860)—17 Mar 1839—Zelph Co-discoverer—[Excommunicated by a conference of the church](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheChurchhcVolumes1-7original1902EditionPdf/page/n667), but [later reinstated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/burr-riggs).

According to the official History of the Church, "[Mr. Bishop was tried by the High Council, his papers examined, condemned and burned, and he cut off the Church](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-4-chapter-33). He acknowledged the justice of the decision, and said 'that he now saw his error, for if he had been governed by the revelations given before, he might have known that no man was to write revelations for the Church, but Joseph Smith,' and begged to be prayed for, and forgiven by the brethren." He does not appear to have rejoined the church, and died in 1844 of "swamp fever".

#### Late Joseph Smith Era
* [Gladden Bishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop) (1809-1864)—11 Mar 1842—Would-be Prophet—[Excommunicated for promulgating his own revelations deemed inconsistent with those of the church](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/21). His trial was held before the Nauvoo High Council with Joseph Smith presiding. When asked to present his revelations, Bishop initially refused, but Joseph Smith invoked his mayoral authority to issue a "warrant" for the revelations which were then obtained. Bishop read portions of his revelations aloud and was met with laughter for what the official record termed "the extreme of folly, nonsense, absurdity, falsehood, and bombastic egotism". The revelations were then ["condemned" and "committed to the flames" and he was "cut off from the church and given over to the buffetings of Satan untill the day of the Lord Jesus](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets?id=28b53d73-2ba2-418b-8ef7-dafcc935bee3&crate=0&index=140)."

Bennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bennett) (1804-1867)—11 May 1842—Physician, Assistant President in First Presidency, Nauvoo Mayor, Spiritual Wifery Proponent—[Excommunicated for adultery](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/john-cook-bennett) on account of his practice of "spiritual wifery", a form of free love. Soon thereafter he was expelled from the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, and he and his wife divorced. In turn he accused Joseph Smith of attempting to assassinate former Governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs, and of adulterous relationships under the guise of polygamy. Bennett later went on to join the Strangite faction of Mormonism, from which he was also excommunicated for sexual improprieties. He also became known for his promotion of the tomato and certain breeds of chickens.

* [Chauncey L. Higbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauncey_L._Higbee) (1821-1884)—20 May 1842—Seducer, _Nauvoo Expositor_ [editor](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/chauncey-lawson-higbee)—[Excommunicated for "unchaste and unvirtuous conduct"](https://archive.org/stream/NauvooHighCouncilMinutes/Nauvoo%20High%20Council%20Minutes_djvu.txt) and teaching "the doctrine that it was right to have free intercourse with women if it was kept secret &c and also... that Joseph Smith authorized him to practise these things &c." [The testimony of the three witnesses at his excommunication trial (as well as one other)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Testimony_against_Chauncey_L._Higbee) was published in the _Nauvoo Neighbor_ two years later. He had told the widow Sarah Miller that physician John C. Bennett would perform abortions should she become pregnant.

* [Orson Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Pratt) (1811-1881)—20 Aug 1842—Philosopher, original member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/orson-pratt) for declining to endorse Joseph Smith's moral character in light of accusations that the prophet had proposed plural marriage to Orson's wife in his absence. [Rebaptized](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-1-21-december-1842-10-march-1843/154) alongside his wife 20 Jan 1843.

Aug 1842—First wife of Orson Pratt, Anti-Polygamy Society supporter, self-proclaimed apostate—[Probably excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/sarah-marinda-bates-pratt) for "adultery" on accusations that she had an affair with the excommunicated John C. Bennett. This followed John C. Bennett's own allegations that Joseph Smith had proposed plural marriage to Sarah Pratt while her husband, Orson, was abroad on a mission. She was [rebaptized](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-1-21-december-1842-10-march-1843/154) alongside her husband 20 Jan 1843.

* [William Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Law_(Latter_Day_Saints)) (1809-1892)—18 Apr 1844—First Presidency member, founder and president of the dissident True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, _Nauvoo Expositor_ publisher—[Excommunicated in absentia](https://archive.org/details/WilliamLawNauvooDissenter/page/n13) for ["unchristianlike conduct"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-4-1-march-22-june-1844/93) due to his involvement with the _Nauvoo Expositor_. He had served in the First Presidency since 1841 but was [removed from that office for opposition to polygamy](https://archive.org/details/WilliamLawNauvooDissenter/page/n19). He expressed additional concerns about Joseph Smith's [doctrine of exaltation](https://archive.org/details/WilliamLawNauvooDissenter/page/n15) and [intermingling of ecclesiastical and economic affairs](https://archive.org/details/WilliamLawNauvooDissenter/page/n13).

[Joseph Smith may have made her sealing to him a precondition for her sealing to her husband](https://archive.org/details/WilliamLawNauvooDissenter/page/n17). It is unclear whether she was actually sealed to Joseph Smith, though it appears that she eventually assented to the sealing.

* [Wilson Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Law) (1806-1876)—18 Apr 1844—Nauvoo Legion Brigadier General, _Nauvoo Expositor_ publisher, brother of William Law—[Excommunicated for "unchristianlike conduct"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-4-1-march-22-june-1844/93) for his involvement with the _Nauvoo Expositor_.

* Howard Smith—18 Apr 1844——[Excommunicated for "unchristianlike conduct"](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1842-june-1844-book-4-1-march-22-june-1844/93) alongside the _Nauvoo Expositor_ publishers, though his involvement is unclear.

* [Austin Cowles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Cowles) (1792-1872)—18 May 1844—Hymnist and anti-polygamy crusader—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-19) on account of his strenuous opposition to polygamy. He went on to publicly denounce Mormon polygamy in the _Nauvoo Expositor_, whose first and only printing led to the arrest and death of Joseph Smith.

* James Blakeslee (1802-1866)—18 May 1844——[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-19). In a _tour de schism_ he [followed](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/james-blakeslee) Sidney Rigdon after Joseph Smith's death, then James J. Strang, then Charles B. Thompson (the "Baneemyites"), finally finding a spiritual home in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints where he became an apostle.

* [Francis M. Higbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_M._Higbee) (1820-1856)—18 May 1844—_Nauvoo Expositor_ editor, Nauvoo Legion colonel—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-19). He went on to participate in the publication of the _Nauvoo Expositor_, leading to the arrest and death of Joseph Smith.

* [Charles Ivins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ivins) (1799-1875)—18 May 1844—Dissenting bishop, _Nauvoo Expositor_ publisher—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-19). He had been appointed bishop of a new church formed by dissenters. Following his excommunication, he was one of the publishers of the _Nauvoo Expositor_, the destruction of which resulted in the arrest and death of Joseph Smith.

* [James Strang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Strang) (1813-1856)—26 Aug 1844—Legislator, naturalist, would-be successor to Joseph Smith, self-proclaimed King of the Kingdom of God—[Excommunicated by the church he sought to lead](https://web.archive.org/web/20180709010154/http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n16.htm) for claiming that Joseph Smith had appointed him as his successor, and that his calling had been confirmed by the appearance of an angel upon the prophet's death. Strang rejected the LDS Church's authority to excommunicate him, the (purported) president of the church, without trial. His claim to the prophetic mantle rested upon a controversial Letter of Appointment supposedly sent by Joseph Smith 18 Jun 1844, and upon his translation of the Voree Plates. His [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_(Strangite)), headquartered on Beaver Island on Lake Michigan, became a substantial rival to Brigham Young's faction with 12,000 adherents. He later claimed to translate a portion of the "Plates of Laban", producing "The Book of the Law of the Lord". In 1849 he abruptly embraced polygamy, ultimately marrying four additional wives, and in 1850 he had himself crowned king of the Kingdom of God. He was assassinated in 1856.

* Aaron Smith—26 Aug 1844—James Strang supporter—[Excommunicated for his part furthering James Strang's claim to church leadership](https://web.archive.org/web/20180709010154/http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v5n16.htm).

#### Interregnum
* [Josiah Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Butterfield) (1795-1871)—7 Oct 1844—Member of the Presidency of the Seventy—[Excommunicated](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/josiah-butterfield) as a consequence of disaffection stemming from a personal conflict with Joseph Smith over an estate settlement. Originally baptized by fellow excommunicant John F. Boynton.

* [George J. Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Adams) (1810-1880)—Apr 1845—Actor, Apostle to Russia, Council of Fifty Member, Failed Colonizer of Israel—[Disfellowshipped and excommunicated for "the most disgraceful and diabolical conduct"](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/9468) for supporting Joseph Smith III as Joseph Smith's successor. He [testified in Augusta Cobb's divorce trial](https://web.archive.org/web/20191013205529/http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/IL/whig1847.htm) in which her husband accused her of adultery after her 1843 plural marriage to Brigham Young. Adams later joined James J. Strang's movement and in 1850 personally placed a crown upon Strang's head on Beaver Island, Michigan, crowning Strang king of the Kingdom of God. He was likewise excommunicated from that church. He went on to found the Church of the Messiah and lead an ill-fated band of colonists to Palestine where they hoped to prepare the way for Christ's second coming.

#### Brigham Young Era
* Jesse T. Hartley (1831-1854)—9 Apr 1854—Doomed California lawyer accused of horse-thievery—[Excommunicated at the church's General Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20191013205113/https://user.xmission.com/~research/mormonpdf/storm.pdf) on this denunciation by Brigham Young: "If that Jesse T. Hartley that I voted for yesterday to go on a mission, is the Lawyer that came from oregon last fall---I re\[s\]cind my vote---for that man is a vagrant---a thief, & a robber. He ought to be baptised in Salt Lake with stones tied to him & hold him under 24 hou\[rs\] to wash away one hundredth part of his sins: He ought to be Sent to hell across lots on a missio\[n\] to preach to the damned. If that hartley appointed on a mission is not this one that I speak of, this will not hurt him---but if he is the man, what I have said is right!" Hartley disputed the charges, but he was ultimately "cut off from the church" on a motion by Brigham Young. The cause of Brigham Young's wrath was almost certainly the letter Hartley had written shortly before to U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, urging him to get Brigham Young removed as territorial governor and to use federal troops to impose order. The letter never arrived at its destination, apparently being diverted due to its content and finding a home amid Brigham Young's own papers. Jesse T. Hartley was murdered by fellow excommunicant "Wild Bill" Hickman around 1 May 1854 as he attempted to flee eastward to urge action against Brigham Young.

* [Harvey G. Whitlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_G._Whitlock) (1809-after 1880)—prob. by 29 Apr 1859—Early Mormon physician, Book of Commandments witness—Probably excommunicated by 29 Apr 1859 as the "Journal History of the Church" [deemed him an "apostate"](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets?id=6356ac4d-c36f-483c-b90e-37ce4fa02547&crate=0&index=291) on that day. It had previously [reported](https://catalog.churchofjesuschrist.org/assets?id=6356ac4d-c36f-483c-b90e-37ce4fa02547&crate=0&index=266) that he came to Utah in 1849 but "soon became dissatisfied and left for California".

* Orson Pratt, Jr. (1837-1903)—18 Sep 1864—First son of apostle Orson Pratt and Sarah Pratt—[Excommunicated for "unbelief"](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V21N01_86.pdf) by the St. George High Council, the same day he had [testified](https://archive.org/details/SarahPrattShapingOfAnApostate/page/n23) in sacrament meeting, "I have come to the conclusion that Joseph Smith was not especially sent by the Lord to establish this work, and I cannot help it, for I could not believe otherwise, even if I knew I was to suffer for it the next moment." He had previously been called on a mission but [declined to serve](https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/missionary/individual/orson-pratt-jr-1837?lang=eng).

* [William Adams "Wild Bill" Hickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Bill_Hickman) (1815-1883)—[12 Jun 1868](https://web.archive.org/web/20190715200439/https://murderpedia.org/male.H/h/hickman-wiliam-adams.htm)—"Brigham's Destroying Angel"—[Excommunicated (according to him) "for going away \[from Utah\] without permission"](https://archive.org/details/destroyibrighams00hickrich/page/182). A frontiersman and bodyguard for Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, he confessed to numerous murders which he claimed were ordered by Brigham Young in his autobiography, _Brigham's Destroying Angel_. He was posthumously re-baptized by proxy in 1934. (His granddaughter, Annalee Skarin, was excommunicated in 1952.)

* [T. B. H. Stenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._B._H._Stenhouse) (1825-1882)—17 Aug 1870—Godbeite historian—[Excommunicated at his own request after joining the Godbeite movement](https://mormonhistoryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Journal-of-Mormon-History-Vol.-1-1974.pdf) in criticizing Brigham Young's leadership. A failed polygamist (his plural wife Belinda obtained a divorce 25 Nov 1869) he went on to pen _Rocky Mountain Saints_, a groundbreaking (if biased) history of Mormonism, published in 1873. His wife, Fanny Stenhouse, was also excommunicated, for publishing and lecturing against the church.

* [George D. Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_D._Watt) (1812-1881)—3 May 1874—Brigham Young secretary, compiler of Journal of Discourses—Excommunicated for following the teachings of dissident William S. Godbe, and for his role as a leader of the Godbeite movement. He had been disfellowshipped in 1869.

* [Sarah Marinda Bates Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Marinda_Bates_Pratt) (1817-1888)—4 Oct 1874—First wife of Orson Pratt, Anti-Polygamy Society supporter, self-proclaimed apostate—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://archive.org/details/SarahPrattShapingOfAnApostate/page/n25) after rejecting polygamy and objecting to being placed on an equal footing with her husband's other wives. Her disaffection became pronounced after her 57 year-old husband Orson married as his tenth wife 16 year-old Margaret Graham, a teen younger than their own daughter.

* Arthur Pratt—5 Oct 1874—Son of Orson and Sarah Pratt—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://archive.org/details/SarahPrattShapingOfAnApostate/page/n25) the day after his mother, Sarah Pratt, was excommunicated on the same charge. He later explained, "I am the son of my father's first wife, and had a mother who taught me the evils of the system \[of polygamy\]."

* [Fanny Stenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Stenhouse) (1829-1904)—5 Oct 1874—Anti-polygamy memoirist and polemicist—[Excommunicated after delivering her anti-polygamy lecture in Salt Lake City](https://mormonhistoryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Journal-of-Mormon-History-Vol.-1-1974.pdf). She published her anti-polygamy memoir, _Exposé of Polygamy in Utah: A Lady’s Life among the Mormons_, in 1872, and lectured widely on the same theme, leading to her excommunication. A reworked and more polemical version of her book, _Tell It All: The Story of a Life's Experience in Mormonism_ came out in 1875. Her husband, T. B. H. Stenhouse, preceded her in excommunication on account of his adherence to Godbeitism.

* [Ann Eliza Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Eliza_Young) (1844-1917)—10 Oct 1874—Polygamy opponent, ex-wife of Brigham Young—[Excommunicated](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/V20N03.pdf) subsequent to leaving her husband.

Along with fellow apostle Matthias F. Cowley, he had previous resigned the apostleship at the request of church president Joseph F. Smith, to eliminate the awkward presence of an avowed polygamist in church leadership during the Reed-Smoot hearings.

* [Matthias F. Cowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_F._Cowley) (1858-1940)—11 May 1911—Resigned Apostle, Polygamist, Sermonizer—[Deprived of "the right and authority to exercise any of the functions of the priesthood" for "insubordination to the government and discipline of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045396/1911-05-13/ed-1/seq-6/), specifically for continued involvement with plural marriages not authorized by the church. Along with fellow apostle John W. Taylor, he had previous resigned the apostleship at the request of church president Joseph F. Smith, to eliminate the awkward presence of an avowed polygamist in church leadership during the Reed-Smoot hearings. His non-standard penalty for insubordination was removed and his priesthood restored 3 Apr 1936.

* [J. Leslie Broadbent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Leslie_Broadbent) (1891-1935)—18 Jul 1929—Polygamist, early leader in Mormon Fundamentalism—[Excommunicated](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112073750/http://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Louis-Alma-Kelsch-1905-1974.pdf).

[He became leader of the Apostolic United Brethren](https://web.archive.org/web/20150529185408/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/us/owen-allred-91-leader-of-polygamous-sect-dies.html) polygamist group when his brother was murdered by a rival faction. In 1978 when the LDS Church rescinded its ban on black members being ordained or participating in higher temple ordinances, [Allred voiced strident opposition to the change](https://web.archive.org/web/20190624172419/https://www.sltrib.com/news/polygamy/2018/05/25/right-after-the-mormon-church-gave-blacks-the-priesthood-a-polygamous-offshoot-saw-its-ranks-grow/), bringing "hundreds" of families into his sect.

* [Helmuth Hübener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_H%C3%BCbener) (8 Jan 1925-27 Oct 1942)—15 Feb 1942—Opponent of the Third Reich—Excommunicated without disciplinary council by his branch president, Nazi Supporter Arthur Zander. Posthumously reinstated by the LDS Church in 1946.

* Maurice Lerrie Glendenning (1891-1969)—15 Jan 1945—Founder of the Aaronic Order or [House of Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Aaron) sect—[Excommunicated for being the "[i]nstigator of [the] 'Aaronic Order'"](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5669&context=etd) because he founded a religious sect apart from the LDS church on the basis of [revelations he claimed to receive from the "Angel Elias"](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V12N01_59.pdf). He had grown up hearing "heavenly music", "angelic poetry", and "doctrinal and philosophical statements" within his own mind, and joined the LDS Church at least in part due to resonances between his revelations and the theology of the church. In 1942 he formally organized the Aaronic Order as a church, for which he was ultimately excommunicated in 1945. His major revelations were 1944's _Book of Elias, or the Record of John_, 1948's _New Revelations for the Book of Elias, or the Record of John_, and 1955's _Disciple Book_, which were later collected as [The Levitical Writings](https://archive.org/details/TheLeviticalWritings).

McKay niece—[Excommunicated for publishing _No Man Knows My History_](https://web.archive.org/web/20190207184806/http://www.salamandersociety.com/x-files/460523brodie_excom.pdf), a biography of Joseph Smith in which she was said to have "assert\[ed\] matters as truths which deny the divine origin of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the Priesthood and of Christ's Church through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, contrary to the beliefs, doctrines and teachings of the Church." She [later stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20191110061253/https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V22N02_81.pdf) that she was "convinced before \[she\] ever began writing \[_No Man Knows My History_\] that Joseph Smith was not a true Prophet." Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith stands alongside Bushman's _Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling_ as a preeminent account of Joseph Smith's life. She went on to write numerous biographies including the prescient _Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History_ which was the first major work to argue that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings.

* [John Horne Blackmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horne_Blackmore) (1890-1971)—1947—Non-polygamous polygamy advocate, educator, Canadian legislator—Excommunicated for "teaching and advocating the doctrine of plural marriage".

Peterson's insistence, to repudiate her book of revelations, _Ye Are Gods_](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/081-42-46.pdf). Elder Peterson's rationale for the top-down decision to excommunicate Annalee Skarin reportedly included the objection that she "attempts to give revelations on her own part and defends this fact even though she is a woman." Soon after her excommunication she claimed to have been translated and seemingly spent the rest of her life in hiding with her husband, Reason Skarin. Her daughter, Hope Hilton, [wrote](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/081-47-48.pdf), "Annalee was a paranoid-schizophrenic who listened to an inner voice whose tapes were often garbled. She was a dramatic actress who sought center stage and applause while proclaiming her humility. She was a master of cover-up which only those on the inside could see."

* Sally Franchow—1952?—Defender of Annalee Skarin—[Excommunicated (according to Annalee Skarin) for defending Annalee in her own excommunication trial](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/081-42-46.pdf).

She and her husband, Jerald Tanner, left the church shortly after their wedding objecting to the church's treatment of its black members as well as historical research that painted a picture of early church leaders which they could not reconcile with belief. They went on to found the _Utah Lighthouse Ministry_ and publish widely on church topics, missionizing Mormons into mainstream Christianity.

* [Jerald Tanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerald_and_Sandra_Tanner) (1 Jun 1938-1 Oct 2006)—14 Aug 1960—_Utah Lighthouse Ministry_ co-founder, publisher on Mormonism—[Excommunicated at his own request for a "voluntary request for \[his\] name to be stricken from the records \[of the church\] and teaching doctrines which are not in harmony with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints"](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113065419/https://collections.lib.utah.edu/file?id=788232&nocache=true).

They went on to found the _Utah Lighthouse Ministry_ and publish widely on church topics, missionizing Mormons into mainstream Christianity.

Richard McCoy, Jr., hijacked a United Airlines passenger jet for ransom in 1972, four months after the more infamous D.B. Cooper carried out a similar and still-unsolved hijacking. Due to the similarity, McCoy has been considered a suspect in the D.B. Cooper crime. He was excommunicated in response to his crimes, and was shot after escaping from prison.

* [Ted Bundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy) (1946-1989)—1976?—Convicted serial killer and rapist—[Excommunicated following his conviction for kidnapping](https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xbMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-PoDAAAAIBAJ&dq=ted%20bundy%20mormon&pg=6890%2C1373449).

Twenty-five years later, taking the missionary discussions a meeting with Mormon missionaries reconverted him, and he rejoined the church in 2004. Writing in the vein of H. P. Lovecraft, Pugmire was described as "perhaps the leading Lovecraftian author writing today".

* [Teresa Nielsen Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Nielsen_Hayden) (b. 21 Mar 1956)—summer 1980—Writer, science fiction editor, ERA proponent—Excommunicated [in response to a denunciatory letter](http://nielsenhayden.com/GodandI.html) she wrote church president Spencer W.

The first General Authority excommunication since Richard R. Lyman in 1943.

* [Deborah Laake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Laake) (1953-2000)—spring/summer 1993—Wrote an ex-Mormon memoir—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045553/http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/10/27/laake/index.html) and [revealing secret temple rituals in her memoir](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/25/style/secrets-revealed.html).

[He was rebaptized](https://www.deseret.com/1996/3/8/19229461/scholar-rebaptized-into-lds-church) 27 Feb 1996 and reported later that [his excommunication had been expunged](https://web.archive.org/web/20190905222333/https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=58060420&itype=CMSID).

After receiving notice of the date of her disciplinary council, she asked that her name be removed from the church's records, but this request was ignored and she was excommunicated despite her desire to resign. [She was rebaptized](https://web.archive.org/web/20191018185738/https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54514350&itype=CMSID) in February 2012.

* Paul Toscano—19 Sep 1993—Founder of the [Mormon Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Alliance) which documented perceived ecclesiastical abuses—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/092-65-79.pdf). He later reported that the disciplinary council focused on his presentation at the 1993 Sunstone Symposium, [_All is Not Well in Zion: False Teachings of the True Church_](http://signaturebookslibrary.org/sancity-of-dissent-09/), which explored "speculative theology" on a number of topics.

She reported that the disciplinary action against her was instigated in response to her Spring 1993 _Dialogue_ article, "[The LDS Intellectual Community and Church Leadership: A Contemporary Chronology](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/V26N01.pdf)" which detailed perceived abuses against intellectuals and feminists.

He had published on post-Manifesto plural marriage, in addition to proposing that folk magical beliefs had a substantial influence on Joseph Smith in _Early Mormonism and the Magic World View_. His stake president's letter referencing "very sensitive and highly confidential" matters aside from his historical writings may suggest that Quinn's gay sexual orientation was a factor in his excommunication.

* David Wright—5 Apr 1994—Brandeis Hebrew prof—Excommunicated for [publishing his view that the Book of Mormon was a 19th-century production](https://web.archive.org/web/20180514212034/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/096-65-77.pdf) in the Sunstone article [Historical Criticism: A Necessary Element In The Search For Religious Truth](https://web.archive.org/web/20180814071722/https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/089.pdf) as well as _"In Plain  Terms That We May Understand":  Joseph Smith's Transformation of Hebrews in Alma 12-13_, a chapter in Brent Metcalfe's _New Approaches to the Book of Mormon_.

The "conduct inappropriate of a member of the church" referred to accusations of verbal abuse against his stepdaughter. His wife Rhonda was [disfellowshipped for her role researching the book](https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/dissident-lds-intellectuals-say-excommunications-will-continue/article_76202a5a-4c5c-5129-9fcd-aefbe0988466.html) and subsequently divorced her husband.

The year prior he had published _Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA and the Book of Mormon_ which argued that DNA evidence does not support the Book of Mormon's apparent claims regarding Native American ancestry. He believed his excommunication was in response to his publications and that the charges of an inappropriate relationship were a way of preventing him from discussing his criticisms of the church during the disciplinary council.

* [Grant Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_H._Palmer) (1940-2017)—12 Dec 2004—Long-time CES educator—[Disfellowshipped for apostasy](https://web.archive.org/save/https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2487004&itype=NGPSID).

Her movement---as well as excommunication---immediately preceded [a raft of changes increasing women's roles in the church](http://religiondispatches.org/historic-prayer-by-woman-at-lds-general-conference-signals-growing-concern-with-gender-equality/), including women praying in General Conference, more prominent female mission leadership, a lowered age for female missionary service, and improved curriculum for the Young Women program.

He advocated honesty in evaluating the historical claims of the LDS church and tried to stay in the faith while not believing the divinity claims. The podcast enabled critical viewpoints to gain a wider audience, and gave doubting and otherwise-marginalized Mormons a sense of community and support.

* Bruce Holt—30 Mar 2016—Software developer—[Excommunicated for a Facebook post denouncing Joseph Smith as a "fraud"](http://www.mormonthink.com/personalstories/bruce-holt.htm).

His Protect LDS Children initiative collected over a thousand stories describing harms experienced during such youth interviews and supported protest actions including a signature drive and hunger strike.

* Bill Reel—2 Dec 2018—_Mormon Dicussions_ podcaster—[Excommunicated for apostasy](https://www.mormonstories.org/podcast/bill-reel-excommunication/) largely for accusing church apostle Jeffrey R.
