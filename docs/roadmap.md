# Roadmap

* Make JSON the "source of truth". Right now the data is contained in README.md but this is messy. Let's make the JSON data primary and generate everything else from that.
* Better define the scope of the project. Are we including people who simply resigned? Do we only include notable figures, or everybody? Are all sorts of reasons included?
* Give a description of the various data fields
* Add location
* Add baptism date
* Add rebaptism date, or indicate if it's known they never rejoined
* Separate formal charges from other notes
* Add a license
* Split the readme up into some separate files since it's so large
