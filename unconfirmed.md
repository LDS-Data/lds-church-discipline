### 20th Century
* [Nathaniel Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Baldwin) (1878-1961)—1905—Monogomous polygamist technologist—He was [fired from his BYU job](https://www.deseret.com/2008/4/14/20082063/new-plans-for-old-factory) probably due to his support for post-Manifesto polygamy, but I find no support that he was excommunicated. He was a technologist whose improvement on the headphones of the day brought financial success, which he channeled to support the nascent Mormon fundamentalist movement. However, he was only married to one woman.

* Martha Nibley Beck——Scholar and author—Excommunicated??? for her public writings which were deemed to be critical of the church. She was a part time faculty at BYU at the time and is the daughter of Hugh Nibley, a well-known Mormon apologist.

* Jason Derek Brown——489th fugitive to be placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted list—No evidence of excommunication yet found.

* [Charles A. Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Foster_(Latter_Day_Saints)) (1815-1904)——_Nauvoo Expositor_ publisher—Excommunicated???

* [Hiram Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Page)———Wikipedia categorizes him as having been excommunicated, but I find no evidence of this. [A 1987 thesis](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/5142/) states explicitly that there is no evidence of excommunication or withdrawal of his license (p. 57)

* [Jacob Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Whitmer) (2 Feb 1800-21 Apr 1856)——One of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon—Joseph Smith Papers says he was [disaffected from the church in 1838](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/jacob-whitmer), but I find no record of disciplinary action. [A Feb 1989 Ensign article](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113003645/http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1989/02/true-to-the-book-of-mormon-the-whitmers?lang=eng) explicitly states that he was never tried for his church membership. The Encyclopedia of Mormonism simply [states that he became "inactive"](https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Book_of_Mormon_Witnesses). Wikipedia is likely wrong to have categorized him as excommunicated.

* [Mary Mussleman Whitmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mussleman_Whitmer) (27 Aug 1778-Jan 1856)——Book of Mormon witness, early Mormon matriarch—She said that, in the time when the Book of Mormon was being translated, a heavenly messenger named Brother Nephi [showed her that golden plates](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113083221/https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/another-account-of-mary-whitmers-viewing-of-the-golden-plates/) as she went out to milk the cows. I have not been able to find evidence she underwent church discipline, other than claims that the entire Whitmer family was excommunicated. Wikipedia may have her wrongly categorized as excommunicated.

* [Peter Whitmer Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Whitmer_Sr.) (14 Apr 1773-12 Aug 1854)——Early Mormon patriarch—With Mary Musselman Whitmer, the father of the Whitmer family influential in early Mormonism. [He became disaffected from the church in 1838](https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/person/peter-whitmer-sr) but I find no evidence he underwent church discipline, except that many articles claim the entire Whitmer family was excommunicated, and Wikipedia categorizes him as excommunicated.
