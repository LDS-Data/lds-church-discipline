If that hartley appointed on a mission is not this one that I speak of, this will not hurt him---but if he is the man, what I have said is right!\" Hartley disputed the charges, but he was ultimately \"cut off from the church\" on a motion by Brigham Young. The cause of Brigham Young's wrath was almost certainly the letter Hartley had written shortly before to U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, urging him to get Brigham Young removed as territorial governor and to use federal troops to impose order. The letter never arrived at its destination, apparently being diverted due to its content and finding a home amid Brigham Young's own papers. Jesse T. Hartley was murdered by fellow excommunicant \"Wild Bill\" Hickman around 1 May 1854 as he attempted to flee eastward to urge action against Brigham Young.",
