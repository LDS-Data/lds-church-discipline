His claim to the prophetic mantle rested upon a controversial Letter of Appointment supposedly sent by Joseph Smith 18 Jun 1844, and upon his translation of the Voree Plates. His Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)), headquartered on Beaver Island on Lake Michigan, became a substantial rival to Brigham Young's faction with 12,000 adherents. He later claimed to translate a portion of the \"Plates of Laban\", producing \"The Book of the Law of the Lord\". In 1849 he abruptly embraced polygamy, ultimately marrying four additional wives, and in 1850 he had himself crowned king of the Kingdom of God. He was assassinated in 1856.",

Strang rejected the LDS Church's authority to excommunicate him, the (purported) president of the church, without trial. His claim to the prophetic mantle rested upon a controversial Letter of Appointment supposedly sent by Joseph Smith 18 Jun 1844, and upon his translation of the Voree Plates. His [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_(Strangite)), headquartered on Beaver Island on Lake Michigan, became a substantial rival to Brigham Young's faction with 12,000 adherents. He later claimed to translate a portion of the \"Plates of Laban\", producing \"The Book of the Law of the Lord\". In 1849 he abruptly embraced polygamy, ultimately marrying four additional wives, and in 1850 he had himself crowned king of the Kingdom of God. He was assassinated in 1856.",
