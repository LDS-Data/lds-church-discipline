He had grown up hearing ""heavenly music"", ""angelic poetry"", and ""doctrinal and philosophical statements"" within his own mind, and joined the LDS Church at least in part due to resonances between his revelations and the theology of the church. In 1942 he formally organized the Aaronic Order as a church, for which he was ultimately excommunicated in 1945. His major revelations were 1944's _Book of Elias, or the Record of John_, 1948's _New Revelations for the Book of Elias, or the Record of John_, and 1955's _Disciple Book_, which were later collected as [The Levitical Writings](https://archive.org/details/TheLeviticalWritings)."
